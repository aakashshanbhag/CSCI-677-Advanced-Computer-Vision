------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code was built on MAC-OS Sierra with python 3.5 and OpenCV 3.1

Files included:
â€¢SIFT.py for matching and homography.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These files can be run with the Opencv version mentioned above with the required packages for python to support them. They can be simply compiled with any Python compiler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments to be passed for Question 1:
./SIFT.py Train.jpg Query.jpg

argv[0]: The compiled executable.
argv[1]: Train Image of any format can be read.
argv[2]: Query/target Image of any format can be read.

Important to note that windows might appear one top of another. Move the windows to best view results. Key press kills all windows.
Top 20 matches are found by taking the key points with minimal distances between the feature vectors between training and target image.
All the inlier matches are shown with homography matrices and good match results displayed.
